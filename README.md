# Serverless Web Application with AWS (Amplify, GraphQL API, Lambda, DynamoDB)
#### This was an assignment for the class CSCE 3420 - Internet Programming

This project demonstrates how to build a fully serverless web application using Amazon Web Services (AWS). It leverages AWS Amplify for rapid front-end deployment, GraphQL API for flexible data querying, AWS Lambda for serverless compute, and Amazon DynamoDB for a NoSQL database.

Basic template is provided by Vite, using a React template.
